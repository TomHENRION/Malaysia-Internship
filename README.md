# Malaysia-Internship
Hello :

This projet contains all the work that I have done during my internship in the University of Technology Petronas.

First of all, for running correctly the algorithm, you need a specific application with deep learning specific librairies.
Follow those instruction to download everything that's requiered :

Go and download this application :
https://anaconda.org/

After installing Anaconda, follow the instructions below :

	* If you use MacOS
conda :
create --name deeplearningalgo python=3.6 anaconda

conda activate deeplearningalgo

conda install theano

conda install tensorflow

conda install keras

conda update --all

IMPORTANT : After installing the modules, you must always get back into the created environment (called deeplearningalgo) using the command : 'source activate deeplearningalgo' before running Spyder. Otherwise, Spyder will launch into the default environment.
	
	* If you use Windows :
conda create --name deeplearningalgo python=3.6 anaconda

activate deeplearningalgo 

conda install theano

conda install tensorflow

conda install keras

conda update --all


IMPORTANT : After installing the modules, you must always get back into the created environment (called deeplearningalgo) using the command : '
activate deeplearningalgo' before running Spyder. Otherwise, Spyder will launch into the default environment.

That's all !
